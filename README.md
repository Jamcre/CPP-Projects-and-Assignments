# C++ Projects and Assignment

**This repository contains projects and assignments I completed while in my Software Design and Analysis courses. Most of the code written is these projects is in C++, and is compiled on the command line using Makefiles. These projects were exercises designed to help me understand various Data Structures and Algorithms, and familiarize me with them so I could incorporate them into any projects I may work on in the future.**

## Softawre Design and Analysis II
* These projects were more elementary, mostly focusing on fundamentals such as Object-Oriented Programming, Inheritance, Polymorphism, etc. Within this subdirectory, a readme file explains each project in a more in-depth manner. 

## Software Design and Analysis III
* These assignments were a bit more advanced, focusing on concepts such as Hashing, Heaps, Dijkstra's Algorithm, etc. For more information on the topics these assignments covered, please look inside the readme in this subdirectory.
